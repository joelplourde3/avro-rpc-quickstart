{"type":"record","name":"ClinicalImpression_Investigation","doc":"A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the clinical workflow. This resource is called \"ClinicalImpression\" rather than \"ClinicalAssessment\" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools such as Apgar score.","namespace":"bio.ferlab.fhir","fields":[{"name":"item","type":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"record","name":"item","doc":"A Reference","namespace":"bio.ferlab.fhir","fields":[{"name":"reference","type":["null","string"],"default":null},{"name":"type","type":["null","string"],"default":null},{"name":"identifier","type":["null","string"],"default":null},{"name":"display","type":["null","string"],"default":null}],"default":{}},"default":[]},"default":[]},{"type":"bio.ferlab.fhir.CodeableConcept","name":"CodeableConcept","default":{}}],"default":null}
